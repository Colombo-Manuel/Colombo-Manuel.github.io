      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding from small to large scale processes controlling the distribution and cycling of trace elements (TEs) and organic carbon (OC) in coastal environments and the open ocean is a primary endeavor of the geoscience community. This require a wide array of integrated knowledge, spanning from geochemistry, biology / microbiology and modelling, to unravel the complexity of freshwater, coastal and marine environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the work collaborators and myself have been tackling include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assessment of freshwater, shelf ocean interaction and sediment resuspension events as significant source terms of bioactive TEs (e.g., Fe, Mn) to coastal water and the Arctic Ocean interior .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study of lateral transport of dissolved and particulate TEs by energetic boundary currents, which incorporate resuspended sediment from the slope, transporting this high signature over long distances at intermediate depth waters.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The investigation of the dynamic interplay among primary production (i.e., synthesis of organic matter), remineralization (i.e., microbial degradation) and scavenging removal modulating the distributions of numerous biogenic derived TEs, phosphorus, nitrogen and OC in the Arctic Ocean and North Subarctic Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The understanding of oceanic processes such water masses circulation in the Arctic Ocean employing dissolved Pb distribution as a transient tracer. Exploiting the large differences in Pb concentrations in the Arctic Ocean, and coupling field observations with model outputs, we traced the evolution of water masses circulating in the Arctic. In addition, we studied the scavenging dynamics developing a pseudo first order scavenging model to study the behaviour of dissolved Mn in deep, old and isolated waters.

      <title>Riverine and Estuarine Geochemistry – the land to ocean continuum</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;River systems and estuaries along with continental margins are a central component of the Earth’s OC and TE cycles by integrating multiple reservoirs and acting as source and/or sink terms. As such, in the B.A.B Lab we study from gauging the magnitude and processes governing the supply of TEs from rivers and continental shelf (especially bioactive TEs), to the complex processes that control OC cycling and transport along the river-ocean mixing endmembers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some work in this section includes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncovering how latitudinal gradients of environmental conditions and bedrock geology control the distributions of TEs, rare earth element and isotopes in freshwater systems, and establishing baselines to evaluate the consequences of future anthropogenic impacts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Assessing the significance of continental contributions of TEs to the coastal environment under different environmental/climatic scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studying the OC cycling along river ocean endmembers by employing a suite array of techniques such as bulk and compound specific stable isotopes and radiocarbon analyses, ramped oxidation analyses and microbial tracers. Coupling all these measurements, we are aiming to shed light on the complex processes (e.g. particulate settling, flocculation, increased productivity, degradation) which control the carbon cycling and transport along the river-ocean interphase, where strong gradients in biological, physical and chemical conditions take place. A special emphasis is given to study the terrestrial organic carbon alterations across the salinity gradient, which in turn affect organic carbon burial efficiency and yield climate implications.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human activities are a key source of pollutants to freshwater systems and the coastal environment, as well as, some chemicals have deleterious effects on human health. Throughout collaborative work with excellent colleagues, we work on multiple projects spanning from tracing urban-industrial effluents in rivers to pharmaceuticals in hospitals. Although it is not the primary research focus  in the B.A.B. Lab, we aim to develop it further in the coming years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the project we work on include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We study the molecular composition and alteration of sterols and fatty acids from various environmental matrices (suspended particles, sediments, fishes, etc.) to trace   anthropogenic contamination from urban-industrial effluents in the Rio de La Plata, Argentina, contrasting highly impacted areas vs. non polluted tributaries. We also employ these biomarkers to obtain information about the diagenetic alteration of organic matter at the sediment water interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Buenos Aires fishes have higher concentrations of fecal sterols (e.g., coprostanol, epicoprostanol) compared to those sampled in the tributary rivers, which have a dominance of plant sterols (e.g., sitosterol, campesterol), and thus, reflect a more “natural” diet. &#34; srcset=&#34;

      In this Principal Component Analysis of Prochilodus lineatus muscle sterol composition, the population of detritivorous fishes feeding predominantly in the proximities of the polluted Buenos Aires city (red) are clearly differentiated from those fishes feeding in the northern tributary rivers (green; less polluted). Buenos Aires fishes have higher concentrations of fecal sterols (e.g., coprostanol, epicoprostanol) compared to those sampled in the tributary rivers, which have a dominance of plant sterols (e.g., sitosterol, campesterol), and thus, reflect a more “natural” diet.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We developed and optimized a method for analyzing pharmaceuticals by HPLC MS/MS from surface samples, which was then applied in multiple studies to trace antineoplastic contamination in health care centers across Canada. This method was recently employed in Argentinean health care centers, being the first study dealing with this increasingly problematic issue in South American countries.&lt;/li&gt;
