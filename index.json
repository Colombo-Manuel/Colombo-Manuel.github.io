Bioactive trace metal data of important micronutrients for algae across the global ocean, such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), are key indicators of biogeochemical change. However, trace metal data in the Arctic have been historically sparse and generally confined to ice-free regions. In 2015, three major GEOTRACES expeditions sought to resolve trace metal distributions across the Arctic, covering the western, eastern, and Canadian Arctic sectors. The diverse Arctic shelves displayed unique controls on Fe and Mn cycling due to differing chemical, biological, and physical properties. Here, we contrast the shallow, reducing Chukchi Shelf in the western Arctic with the tidally forced, advective Canadian Arctic and the deeper, less productive Barents Shelf in the eastern Arctic. Reductive dissolution and physical resuspension both proved to be large sources of Fe and Mn to the Arctic and the North Atlantic outflow. In the isolated intermediate and deep waters, one-dimensional scavenging in the western and eastern Arctic contrasts with vertical biological signals in Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea.\n","date":1717372800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717372800,"objectID":"b1989406b72becf1c81e358cc521834a","permalink":"https://Colombo-Manuel.github.io/publications/ocy_2024/","publishdate":"2024-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/ocy_2024/","section":"publications","summary":"Jensen L. and __Colombo M.__ (2024) _Oceanography 37(2), 60–71_\n","tags":["Coastal","TEs"],"title":"Shelf-basin connectivity drives dissolved Fe and Mn distributions in the western Arctic Ocean: A synoptic view into polar trace metal cycling\n","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"🎉🎉 Our new paper “Shelf-basin connectivity drives dissolved Fe and Mn distributions in the western Arctic Ocean: A synoptic view into polar trace metal cycling” has been published.

Sharp increase in dissolved and particulate Fe, as well as other lithogenic-derived TEs, in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago at places where sediment resuspension was higher (i.e., \u0026gt; transmissivity drop), whereas noticeable lower values were measured in the tranquil waters in the western archipelago region. The study of lateral transport of dissolved and particulate TEs by energetic boundary currents, which incorporate resuspended sediment from the slope, transporting this high signature over long distances at intermediate depth waters. The investigation of the dynamic interplay among primary production (i.e., synthesis of organic matter), remineralization (i.e., microbial degradation) and scavenging removal modulating the distributions of numerous biogenic derived TEs, phosphorus, nitrogen and OC in the Arctic Ocean and North Subarctic Atlantic Ocean. The positive correlation between apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and dissolved Fe (dFe) concentrations in intermediate water depth in Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea evidence the input of this important micronutrient as result of organic matter degradation by microbial activity. On the contrary, at greater depths, scavenging removal overpass remineralization inputs as shown in the dFe vs. AOU relationship for Baffin Bay Deep Waters (BBDW) and Denmark Strait Overflow Waters (DSOW). The redox cycling of dissolved Fe and Mn at the sediment water interphase, as well as, the study of microbially mediated Mn oxidation in subsurface Arctic waters.\nThe understanding of oceanic processes such water masses circulation in the Arctic Ocean employing dissolved Pb distribution as a transient tracer. Exploiting the large differences in Pb concentrations in the Arctic Ocean, and coupling field observations with model outputs, we traced the evolution of water masses circulating in the Arctic. In addition, we studied the scavenging dynamics developing a pseudo first order scavenging model to study the behaviour of dissolved Mn in deep, old and isolated waters. The relative contribution of Arctic waters vs. Atlantic derived waters –having a higher dissolved Pb signature due to anthropogenic contamination– is reflected in the dPb profiles. At station BB3 the greater contribution of Arctic waters mixing with Atlantic derived water result in a modest increase in dPb in the ~400-800 m range, while at BB1 the larger proportion of Atlantic waters clearly translate in much higher dPb at this station.

For instance, the TE signature of small permafrost dominated rivers in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is strongly dominated by North to South gradients in environmental conditions as the development of permafrost soils and vegetation, soil organic carbon content, river discharge, and permafrost active layer thickness. Additionally, the bedrock geology of their respective drainage basins also contributes to the TE signature. Assessing the significance of continental contributions of TEs to the coastal environment under different environmental/climatic scenarios. Studying the OC cycling along river ocean endmembers by employing a suite array of techniques such as bulk and compound specific stable isotopes and radiocarbon analyses, ramped oxidation analyses and microbial tracers. Coupling all these measurements, we are aiming to shed light on the complex processes (e.g. particulate settling, flocculation, increased productivity, degradation) which control the carbon cycling and transport along the river-ocean interphase, where strong gradients in biological, physical and chemical conditions take place.

In this Principal Component Analysis of Prochilodus lineatus muscle sterol composition, the population of detritivorous fishes feeding predominantly in the proximities of the polluted Buenos Aires city (red) are clearly differentiated from those fishes feeding in the northern tributary rivers (green; less polluted). Buenos Aires fishes have higher concentrations of fecal sterols (e.g., coprostanol, epicoprostanol) compared to those sampled in the tributary rivers, which have a dominance of plant sterols (e.g., sitosterol, campesterol), and thus, reflect a more “natural” diet.

Despite the worldwide growing concern regarding these drugs and sustained monitoring efforts in developed countries, there is almost no data about surface contamination levels in Argentina, in particular, and South America, in general. Methods: Antineoplastic drug contamination was measured in three Argentinean public hospitals (pharmacy and daycare center areas) by surface wiping and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Results and Discussion: Eleven drugs were detected, in 51 of 58 sampled surfaces, in variable concentrations from 0.00064 to 7.3 ng cm−2, with cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel as the most prevalent drugs. This highly variable antineoplastic distribution reflects differences in facility layout, number of patients, antineoplastic drug use, etc., at each hospital. Values exceeding the 1 ng cm−2 threshold were detected in 13 surfaces of the two hospitals handling the largest amounts of antineoplastic drugs. The cyclophosphamide 75th percentile averaged 0.030 ng cm−2 comparable to the high values reported more than 10 years ago for developed countries, emphasizing the potential of reducing antineoplastic contamination by implementing routine monitoring and improved cleaning and handling procedures. Conclusion: This study is the first survey of multi-compound surface antineoplastic contamination in Argentinean (and South American) hospitals, providing a baseline against which future studies can be compared. Widespread antineoplastic contamination has been detected on numerous surfaces, with concentrations surpassing suggested threshold exposure levels (1 ng cm−1) for some surfaces in two of the sampled hospitals.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"b0a9c56430a81b7ccf1de95af30e7721","permalink":"https://Colombo-Manuel.github.io/publications/jopp_2023/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/jopp_2023/","section":"publications","summary":"Speranza E.D., Jeronimo M. and __Colombo M.__ (2023) _Journal of Oncology Pharmacy Practice 2023;0(0)_","tags":["EnvirHealth"],"title":"Initial assessment of multi-compound antineoplastic drug surface contamination in Argentinean healthcare centers: Insights into occupational exposures in South America\n","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://Colombo-Manuel.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://Colombo-Manuel.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Abstract: Marine particles are important regulators of the biogeochemistry of many trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and as such, there has been an increasing motivation to unravel the processes which control their cycling. Here, we present vertical distributions of total particulate trace elements (Al, V, Fe, Mn and P) and particulate organic carbon and particulate nitrogen (POC and pN) collected during the GEOTRACES Canadian cruise in 2015 in the Canada Basin (CB), the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), Baffin Bay (BB) and the Labrador Sea (LS), where particulate trace metal data are scarce. While particulate trace elements are generally affected by one-dimensional dynamics in ocean waters (e.g. deposition, scavenging/remineralization, and sinking), lateral transport of lithogenic-derived particles (pAl, pV and pFe) plays a dominant role in shaping their distributions in the deep CB, BB and LS basins. Higher concentrations of the aforementioned particulate trace elements are measured along the flow path of boundary currents and in near-bottom waters. Unlike pAl, pV and pFe, primarily controlled by lithogenic sources, bulk pMn distributions in our study regions (with the exception of LS) are dominated by authigenic Mn+3/4 oxides, with distinctively high concentrations in CB and BB subsurface halocline waters, as well as in the deepest samples in BB. Enhanced bacterially-mediated Mn+2 oxide formation is anticipated to occur in these halocline waters which have the potential to sustain large populations of Mn oxidizing bacteria as result of the close sediment-water interactions and distinct environmental conditions of these water masses. Overall, the highest concentrations of pP, POC and pN occurred in surface and near-surface waters (\u0026gt;100 m) at the same density as a chlorophyll-a peak and transmissivity drop, with a clear west-east increasing concentration gradient from the CB to LS. In summary, biogeochemical cycles of particulate elements in the Canadian Arctic Ocean are controlled by enhanced lateral transport and sediment resuspension (pAl, pFe and pV), authigenic formation of Mn and biological production (pP, POC and pN).\n","date":1641254400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641254400,"objectID":"d41da7854b58576a7e841b6d6ebcb237","permalink":"https://Colombo-Manuel.github.io/publications/gca_2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/gca_2022/","section":"publications","summary":"__Colombo M.__, Li J., Rogalla B., Allen S.E. and Maldonado M.T.

However, it is difficult to assess the net effect of this supply mechanism due to the spatial heterogeneity of sea ice content. Manganese (Mn) is a micronutrient and tracer which integrates source fluctuations in space and time while retaining seasonal variability. The Arctic Ocean surface Mn maximum is attributed to freshwater, but studies struggle to distinguish sea ice and river contributions. Informed by observations from 2009 IPY and 2015 Canadian GEOTRACES cruises, we developed a three-dimensional dissolved Mn model within a 1/12° coupled ocean-ice model centered on the Canada Basin and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA). Simulations from 2002 to 2019 indicate that annually, 87%–93% of Mn contributed to the Canada Basin upper ocean is released by sea ice, while rivers, although locally significant, contribute only 2.2%–8.5%. Downstream, sea ice provides 34% of Mn transported from Parry Channel into Baffin Bay. While rivers are often considered the main source of Mn, our findings suggest that in the Canada Basin they are less important than sea ice. However, within the shelf-dominated CAA, both rivers and sediment resuspension are important. Climate-induced disruption of the transpolar drift may reduce the Canada Basin Mn maximum and supply downstream. Other micronutrients found in sediments, such as Fe, may be similarly affected.

Together with the most recent synopsis of Arctic-Atlantic volume fluxes, the observed trace element distributions suggest that FS is the most important gateway for Arctic-Atlantic dissolved micronutrient exchange as a consequence of Intermediate and Deep Water transport. Combining fluxes from FS and the Barents Sea Opening with estimates for Davis Strait (GN02, 2015) suggests an annual net southward flux of 2.7 ± 2.4 Gg·a−1 dFe, 0.3 ± 0.3 Gg·a−1 dCo, 15.0 ± 12.5 Gg·a−1 dNi and 14.2 ± 6.9 Gg·a−1 dCu from the Arctic toward the North Atlantic Ocean.

Dissolved REE concentrations increase with increasing fractions of metamorphic rocks and ice cover in the rivers’ watersheds, while εNd and PAAS-normalized REE patterns are inherited from the watershed’s bedrock lithology. The four rivers draining watersheds composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks exhibit the highest REE concentrations, the least radiogenic εNd, and shale-normalized patterns enriched in light REEs. The remaining nine rivers drain mainly or exclusively sedimentary bedrock and have lower REE concentrations, more radiogenic εNd and generally show heavy REE enrichment, with variable negative cerium (Ce) anomalies. The presence of ice sheets in the drainage area, and the ionic strength, pH, and dissolved organic carbon concentration of river water are the main factors determining riverine dissolved REE concentrations by controlling the formation and stabilization of colloids. We estimate a flow of dissolved Nd transported by Arctic rivers discharging into the CAA equivalent to the Nd flux of seawater entering the CAA. Depending on the percentage of Nd removal during mixing with seawater, the impact of river water on the εNd of seawater exiting the CAA could be modest (if 90% removal) or more significant (if ≪90% removal).

Here, we measured dPb isotopes in Arctic seawater with very low dPb concentrations (average ∼5 pmol ⋅ kg−1) and show that anthropogenic Pb is pervasive and often dominant in the western Arctic Ocean. Pb isotopes further reveal that historic aerosol Pb from Europe and Russia (Eurasia) deposited to the Arctic during the 20th century, and subsequently remobilized, is a significant source of dPb, particularly in water layers with relatively higher dPb concentrations (up to 16 pmol ⋅ kg−1). The 20th century Eurasian Pb is present predominantly in the upper 1,000 m near the shelf but is also detected in older deep water (2,000 to 2,500 m). These findings highlight the importance of the remobilization of anthropogenic Pb associated with previously deposited aerosols, especially those that were emitted during the peak of Pb emissions in the 20th century. This remobilization might be further enhanced because of accelerated melting of permafrost and ice along with increased coastal erosion in the Arctic. Additionally, the detection of 20th century Eurasian Pb in deep water helps constrain ventilation ages. Overall, this study shows that Pb isotopes in Arctic seawater are useful as a gauge of changing particulate and contaminant sources, such as those resulting from increased remobilization (e.g., coastal erosion) and potentially also those associated with increased human activities (e.g., mining and shipping).\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"7941e5e17f4315586f48179be4846a97","permalink":"https://Colombo-Manuel.github.io/publications/pnas_2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/pnas_2021/","section":"publications","summary":"De Vera J., Chandan P., Pinedo Gonzales P., John S., Jackson S.L., Cullen J.T., __Colombo M.__, Orians K.J. and Bergquist B.A. (2021) _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 118 (24), 1-6_","tags":["Coastal","TEs"],"title":"Anthropogenic lead pervasive in Canadian Arctic seawater\n","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rAbstract: Contamination of multiple antineoplastic drugs (ADs) on work surfaces presents an exposure concern for health care workers. Surface wipe sampling is a recognized method to evaluate the degree of contamination present. Our research team has previously reported on wipe sampling and analytical methods to simultaneously detect 10 commonly used ADs from a single wipe. Our objectives here were: to field test a protocol consisting of the wipe sampling method and an accompanying wipe sample collection tool kit and confirm this protocol can be effectively used by health care workers to assess drug contamination levels in their facilities; and, to confirm the potential for simultaneous exposure to multiple antineoplastic drugs. Three facilities within one health authority in British Columbia, Canada participated in this field study. In collaboration with the site health and safety advisors, up to 25 surfaces within each facility were considered for sampling. Collected wipe samples were analyzed using HPLC-MS/MS to quantify the 10 analyte, resulting in 750 potential analyses. Following the sampling, each of the three facilities’ safety advisors provided feedback regarding the usability of the protocols. Among the 72 wipe samples actually collected (or 720 analyses conducted), detectable levels and simultaneous contamination of work surfaces of five of the 10 analytes were found at all three participating sites: 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, paclitaxel, and methotrexate; (range \u0026lt; LoD to 33.0 ng/cm2) with 5-fluorouracil having the highest concentration in every instance. Drug contamination was found on a variety of different work surfaces in pharmacies and patient care areas among all three sites.

In this work we present the spatial distributions and biogeochemical cycling of these metals across the Canadian GEOTRACES transect in the Canadian Arctic Ocean during the summer and autumn of 2015. Surface concentrations are dominated by freshwater inputs showing a strong negative correlation with salinity, especially for DMn which behaves more conservatively than DFe. The highest surface concentrations were measured in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Fe: 0.401–1.91 and Mn: 4.33–9.54 nmol kg−1) and the Canada Basin (Fe: 0.225–0.479 and Mn: 3.93–7.02 nmol kg−1), regions highly influenced by riverine inputs, whereas the lowest values were found in the Labrador Sea (Fe: 0.106–0.362 and Mn: 0.450–1.09 nmol kg−1) where freshwater inputs diminished and phytoplankton uptake increased. Subsurface and deep water distributions for both metals are largely controlled by a complex balance between sources (advective inputs and organic matter remineralization) and removal processes. The subsurface peaks (∼100–300 m) observed in the Canada Basin (Fe: 0.541 ± 0.060 and Mn: 1.38 ± 0.42 nmol kg−1) and Baffin Bay (Fe: 0.753–1.03 nmol kg−1) were advected from the Chukchi Sea and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago respectively, where DFe and DMn are released from the benthic boundary layer in these shelf-dominated environments. Advective sources associated with the Arctic Circumpolar Boundary Current, rather than vertical fluxes of DFe and DMn in sinking particles, dominate metal distributions in the deep Canada Basin waters (\u0026gt;300 m). In the highly productive Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea, organic matter remineralization is a notable source of DFe and DMn to deep waters. In the deepest waters (\u0026gt;1000 m), scavenging of DFe and DMn govern their vertical distributions; a pseudo-first order scavenging model explained the continuous removal of DMn in the Canada Basin, where the concentrations reach uniformly low concentrations (0.150 ± 0.004 nmol kg−1) after ∼400 years. Applying this DMn scavenging model we were able to estimate the age (120–190 years) of deep Baffin Bay waters, a topic of discussion for many years.\n","date":1577923200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577923200,"objectID":"481f85000d8bfa3c29aabe881c9f0fc2","permalink":"https://Colombo-Manuel.github.io/publications/gca_2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/gca_2020/","section":"publications","summary":"__Colombo M.__, Jackson S.L., Cullen J.T. and Orians K.J.

Sterol concentrations were fairly homogeneous (2.4 ± 1.3 mg g−1 dry weight), but their proportion in lipids was highly variable and inversely related to both body mass and lipid contents, reflecting the more conservative character of sterols compared to the rapid accumulation of fat as fish grows. As expected, the muscle sterol signature was widely dominated by cholesterol (92 ± 4.5% of total sterols), but it exhibited a remarkable diversity with variable proportions of fecal coprostanol (4.0 ± 4.4%) and plant sterols (3.1 ± 1.9%, e.g. sitosterol and campesterol). Muscle sterols exhibited contrasting geographical differences associated with dietary shifts from plant-derived detritus in the northern reaches of the basin (N: Paraná and Uruguay Rivers), to sewage dominated inputs at Buenos Aires (BA). Fish from BA are fattier (lipids: 35 ± 18 vs. 15 ± 9.0% at N), with higher total sterol contents (2.6 ± 1.3 vs. 1.9 ± 1.0 mg g−1), abundant coprostanol (5.3 ± 4.4 vs. 0.46 ± 1.1%) and lower plant sterols (2.6 ± 1.6 vs 4.6 ± 2.0%), reflecting a diet shifted to anthropogenic organic matter as opposed to vegetal detritus in the north. Accordingly, BA fish presented lower phyto/fecal sterol ratios (0.37 ± 0.21 vs. 0.91 ± 0.12 at N) and higher copro/epicoprostanol ratios (0.95 ± 0.082 vs 0.51 ± 0.25 at N), indicating fresh fecal inputs which provide a valuable supply of easily absorbed organic matter at this site. In addition, the sterol signature allowed to distinguish migratory fish from BA collected 900 km north (previously identified by their pollutant fingerprint and biochemical composition).

The largest Arctic rivers are known to play an important role in the cycling of trace metals in the Arctic Ocean; however, these systems account for little more than half of Arctic freshwater discharge, leaving a major gap in our understanding of the trace metal geochemistry from smaller river systems. This is especially problematic for rivers draining the Arctic coastal margins, as these continuous permafrost systems are anticipated to be particularly sensitive to climate change. This study presents the first observations of dissolved and particulate trace metal concentrations and lead isotopes in 14 rivers in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA). Dissolved concentrations of aluminum, iron, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, and lead display clear spatial variability in their distributions. Small rivers located in the central islands of the CAA have remarkably low concentrations of these trace metals, while the rivers draining the southern continental landmass have higher values. This geographic variability in dissolved metal concentrations reflects both differences in bedrock geology and the South-North environmental gradients in the Archipelago. We extrapolate these findings to estimate the dissolved trace metal concentrations for other rivers draining the CAA based on their geographic location. Elemental ratios measured in the suspended particulate matter in several rivers indicates a significant enrichment of nickel, copper, zinc, and lead over the crustal composition. In particular, lead isotope composition shows an extremely large range, varying from the highly radiogenic Tree River (206Pb/207Pb: 1.5121) in the south, to the relatively unradiogenic Glacier River (206Pb/207Pb: 1.0153) in the central CAA. Lack of correlation between the Pb isotopic composition and Pb enrichment, suggests Pb is derived from within the watershed. This work presents the first observations of dissolved and particulate trace metal concentrations in small coastal draining rivers from the CAA, an important first step in developing a baseline against which to evaluate future change in the high Arctic.\n","date":1546387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546387200,"objectID":"77e4c39f85c011bd968d064cd1eeea16","permalink":"https://Colombo-Manuel.github.io/publications/cg_2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/cg_2019/","section":"publications","summary":"__Colombo M.__, Brown K.A., De Vera J., Bergquist B.A. and Orians K.J.

Dissolved Pb showed an increase in concentration from the Canada Basin toward Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea. Canada Basin was the most isolated region from anthropogenic Pb inputs with low background concentrations (1.4−6.2 pmol kg−1) across most of the basin, although higher Pb features from the advection of Pacific-derived waters and sea ice meltwater were present. Likewise, high-Pb peaks (13.5−26.6 pmol kg−1) along narrow isopycnal surfaces (σθ, 27.4−27.6) in Baffin Bay were attributed to the advection of North Atlantic waters spreading a high-Pb signature into the bay, contrasting with the low values (2.5−7.4 pmol kg−1) present in the mixed layer, Arctic and Baffin Bay deep waters. The Labrador Sea, largely influenced by the recirculation of North Atlantic waters, had the highest Pb concentrations (∼17−34 pmol kg−1) measured in this study. The Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) represents a transition environment influenced by Arctic waters imprinting a low-Pb signature in the western CAA and the southern side of Parry Channel, while Baffin Bay waters prevailed in the eastern CAA recirculating westward along the northern side of Parry Channel and progressively losing their relatively high Pb signature. Extremely low concentrations were measured in Canada Basin and CAA waters, which reflect the remoteness of this region from anthropogenic inputs as well as the old ventilation age of deep waters’ masses, providing a baseline for assessing future Pb studies. Finally, we successfully integrate modeling data with field observations demonstrating that dissolved lead, due to its distinctive anthropogenic signature in North Atlantic waters, can be a useful complementary tracer of water masses in the Canadian Arctic Ocean.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"59bb1c27d5af9ea72b6932334d192e58","permalink":"https://Colombo-Manuel.github.io/publications/acsesp_2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/acsesp_2019/","section":"publications","summary":"__Colombo M.__, Rogalla B., Myers P.G., Allen S.E. and Orians K.J.
